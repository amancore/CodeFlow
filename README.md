# Code Flow

Code Flow is a **React-based** project that provides interactive visualizations for a variety of algorithms. It breaks down complex concepts into step-by-step graphical representations, making it easier for learners to grasp algorithmic principles.

## Overview

Currently, there are **6 main segments**, with a total of **10 algorithms implemented**, and plans to add more in the future.

## Segments

- **Dijkstra**: Visualize shortest path finding in graphs.
- **Prime Numbers**: Explore the distribution and identification of prime numbers.
- **Binary Search**: Demonstrate efficient searching in sorted arrays.
- **Recursion Tree**: Map out recursive function calls and structures.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Graph Search
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Dijkstra
- Recursive Maze Creation

## Other Algorithms
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (for prime numbers)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for development and running the project)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Git (to clone the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-flow.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CodeFlow
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Select an algorithm or segment from the menu.
3. Interact with the visualization: step through processes, adjust parameters (e.g., array size, graph nodes), and observe the algorithm in action.
4. Use controls to play, pause, reset, or speed up the animation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome to expand the library of algorithms or improve existing visualizations! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm
   ```
3. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Add new algorithm visualization'
   ```
4. Push to the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-algorithm
   ```
5. Open a pull request.
