# Code Flow

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. 

Explore more than 24 algorithms with step by step visualization simplifying the learning process and making it more engaging for a better understanding. 

So far there are 6 segments  
- Dijkstra
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Binary Search 
- Recursion Tree

I have implemented a total of `10 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.
