Explore more than 24 algorithms with step by step visualization simplifying the learning process and making it more engaging for a better understanding. 

So far there are 6 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree
- Turing Machine

I have implemented a total of `24 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.
